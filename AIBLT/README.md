# AIB-LT
Adaptive Influence Blocking based on Linear Threshold.

See the paper [Adaptive Influence Blocking: Minimizing the Negative Spread by Observation-based
Policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8731584) for details.

There is Chinese documentation, see `doc/AIBLT_doc_CN.docx`.

There is also a sample config file and dataset in the `sample` folder. Note that it is a made-up dataset only for testing, not a real social network. Real datasets are large and not uploaded in the repository.
